# Scalable Attack Detection IoT

## Pre Processing of Dataset

The data preprocessing of IoT-23 dataset.The lighter version of the dataset contains 23 labled files , these 23 datasets are seperately loaded into Pandas dataframe . First 10 rows of the labled files contains header information so by dropping those columns and combaining all the dataframes into new dataset which is used for further process.
dataset: 
iot23_combined.csv

## Download

You can download the IoT-23 dataset from the following link: [IoT-23 Dataset](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23).
